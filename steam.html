            <p>Grounded was one of those games that has been sitting in my Steam wishlist forever. It was originally
                released for early access in 2020, which is when I started to eye it down to see if it was a good fit
                for me. The game was officially released last year, but it wasn't until recently that I purchased it.
            </p>
            <p>I'm one of those people who only buy games if I have someone to play it with, so I finally bought it when
                I found someone who was willing to go through this game with me. We didn't think much of it as first --
                we play as kids who got shrunk in someone's backyard and must survive. I spent the beginning of the game
                running around confused and lost, but I eventually understood the GUI and was able to progress.</p>
            <p>Once you get the hang of things, the game feels limitless. Even though the map is pre-generated and keeps
                you contained within certain boundaries (in this game it's the fences of a backyard), I feel like there
                is almost infinite content. We already have 45 hours in the game and we're not even 45% of the way done
                exploring. The enemies (which are primarily insects) are insanely well made, each having their own
                attack pattern and locational variance. On top of that, the graphics are breathtakingly beautiful.
                10/10.</p>
