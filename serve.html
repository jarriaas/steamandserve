            <p>Mushroom Risotto is something I started making within the last year. It has grown to be one of my
                favorite foods. This recipe always comes out tasting rich and creamy, and it's definitely worth how much
                time it takes to cook.</p>

            <p>This is the recipe I use:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Ingredient</th>
                    <th>Amount</th>
                    <th>Meijer Cost</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Chicken Broth</td>
                    <td>6 cups</td>
                    <td>$3.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Olive Oil</td>
                    <td>3 tbsp</td>
                    <td>$0.50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mini Bella Mushrooms</td>
                    <td>4 oz</td>
                    <td>$1.75</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shallots</td>
                    <td>2 Medium</td>
                    <td>$1.50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Abrorio Rice</td>
                    <td>1 1/2 cups</td>
                    <td>$2.50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dry White Wine</td>
                    <td>1/2 cup</td>
                    <td>$1.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Parmesan Cheese</td>
                    <td>1/3 cup</td>
                    <td>$0.75</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Butter</td>
                    <td>2 tbsp</td>
                    <td>$0.25</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>It's very similar to the website I linked above, but I made some minor adjustments to better fit my
                taste. The biggest change is that the original recipe uses 2 pounds of mushrooms. I cut it down to about
                Â¼ of what they suggest because even though I love mushrooms, the amount they use feels very heavy and
                becomes overpowering. I like my risotto to have the rice itself be the main attraction.</p>
            <p>The original recipe also states that the rice itself takes around twenty minutes to cook. This is never
                the case for me -- I always end up sitting in front of my stove for around 30-45 minutes. Maybe my
                apartment's stove isn't of the highest quality or maybe I don't set the temperature high enough, but
                spending this much time on a dish I love is no burden to me. Since this recipe ends up making ~5
                portions (relative to how big my bowl is), that's five days where I wake up in the morning excited
                knowing that I get a delicious meal for dinner. 10/10</p>
