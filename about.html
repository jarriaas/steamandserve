            <div class="block-content">Hello! My name is Ashley Jarria, and I am a student at Michigan State University.
                I'm a senior working towards my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, anticipating to graduate in May
                2024.</div>

        <h1>What is this Website?</h1>
        <div class="block" id="web">
            <div class="block-title">Steam &<br>Serve</div>
            <div class="block-content">My idea for this website was to create a platform where I share two of my life's
                greatest pleasures: gaming and cooking. As a busy college student, my packed schedule often leaves
                little room for pursuing hobbies.</div>
        </div>

        <h1>Why this Idea?</h1>
        <div class="block" id="idea">
            <div class="block-title">The Goal</div>
            <div class="block-content">My Steam library is overflowing with untouched games while my fridge is left
                empty for days at a time. This website will be used as a place to reignite my passion for gaming while
                exploring different cuisines, as well as provide a space for others to follow my latest game reviews and
                explore accessible culinary dishes.</div>
